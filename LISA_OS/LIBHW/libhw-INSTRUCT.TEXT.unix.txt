Subject:  Building the Hardware Interface Software

________________________________________________________________________________


The hardware interface package consists of four independent software components:
   1) the Pascal interfaces for compiler USE, in files HARDWARE.OBJ and HWINT.OBJ
   2) the assembly language implementation of this interface, in HWINTL.OBJ
   3) the Monitor version of the drivers, in Monitor file DRIVERS.OBJ
   4) the Lisa OS version of the drivers, in Lisa OS file SYSTEM.LLD

You have built HWINT.OBJ and HWINTL.OBJ in the past.  HARDWARE.OBJ is built by
compiling and code generating HARDWARE.TEXT.  No link is required.  The remainder
of this memo explains how the Monitor and OS drivers (DRIVERS.OBJ and SYSTEM.LLD)
are built.


Building DRIVERS.OBJ for the Monitor:

   a)  Version Toggle  --  Set the equate OSVersion at the beginning of file
       DRIVERS.TEXT to 0 to indicate the Monitor version.

   b)  Includes  --  The source files needed are DRIVERS.TEXT, MOUSE.TEXT,
       CURSOR.TEXT, MACHINE.TEXT, LEGENDS.TEXT, KEYBD.TEXT, and TIMERS.TEXT.
       Includes exist at the end of file DRIVERS.TEXT.

   c)  Assembly  --  Assemble file DRIVERS.TEXT to make object file DRIVERS.OBJ.
       No listing or .SYMBOLS file is needed.  No linking is needed.


Building SYSTEM.LLD for the OS:

   a)  Version Toggle  --  Set the equate OSVersion at the beginning of file
       DRIVERS.TEXT to 1 to indicate the Lisa OS version.

   b)  Includes  --  The source files needed are DRIVERS.TEXT, MOUSE.TEXT,
       CURSOR.TEXT, MACHINE.TEXT, LEGENDS.TEXT, KEYBD.TEXT, and TIMERS.TEXT.
       Includes exist at the end of file DRIVERS.TEXT.

   c)  Assembly  --  Assemble file DRIVERS.TEXT to make object file DRIVERX.OBJ.
       (Note the "X" in DRIVERX.OBJ.)  No listing or .SYMBOLS file is needed.

   d)  Dummy Pascal Program  --  Compile and Generate file DRVRMAIN.TEXT to
       produce DRVRMAIN.OBJ.  This is a tiny dummy program.

   e)  Link  --  Use the old (non-intrinsic) linker to do a physical (-p) link
       of DRIVERX.OBJ, DRVRMAIN.OBJ and *MPASLIB.OBJ to produce SYSTEM.LLD.

   f)  Transfer  --  File SYSTEM.LLD must to transferred to the Lisa OS boot
       volume.
