; point unit.  p must contain a valid pointer to the "top" of this area: the
; address of the highest bite plus one, which is exactly the address stored in
; the intrinsic unit table by the intrinsic unit linker.

; %_initfp is intended to reside in ..paslib and does not use any floating point
; routines.
