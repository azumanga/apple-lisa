  Additional language support in the unit PASLIBCALL :


    function PAbortFlag : boolean;

        This function tells programs that whether Apple-period key combination
        has been pressed (TRUE) or not. This function allows program to gracefully
        exit out of long operations.


    procedure ScreenCtr (contrfun : integer); {standard screen control functions}

        This procedure provides standard screen control functions, such as clear
        the screen, move cursor left, right etc. This procedure
        allows programs to perform screen control without having to use the
        escape sequences for the type of the terminal the system supports.
        The parameter specifies the screen control function. It is defined
        in the constants as follows, and in the PASLIBCALL unit too:

            CclearScreen = 1;           {clear the whole screen}
            CclearEScreen = 2;          {clear to the end of the screen}
            CclearELine = 3;            {clear to end of line}

            CgoHome = 11;               {move cursor to home position}
            CleftArrow = 12;            {move cursor left one character position}
            CrightArrow = 13;           {move cursor right one character position}
            CupArrow = 14;              {move cursor up one line position}
            CdownArrow = 15;            {move cursor down one line position}



    PROCEDURE GetGPrefix (Var prefix : pathname);

        This procedure returns the system global prefix. This prefix is the first
        level prefix setting in the File-Mgr in the Shell.


    procedure GetPrDevice (var PrDevice : e_name);

        This procedure returns the corresponding default printer device name.
        This device is the one used for the logical device '-PRINTER'. Note that
        the device name returned contains a leading '-'.


    procedure PLINITHEAP(var ernum,refnum: integer; size,delta: longint;
                        ldsn: integer; swapable: boolean);
      { Optional Call To Initialize the Heap }

             'The Pascal Heap'.
