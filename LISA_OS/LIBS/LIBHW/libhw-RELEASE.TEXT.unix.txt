Subject:  Hardware Interface Release 9.4

__________________________________________________________________________________

Release 9.4 of the hardware interface is now available from Amy or Kathy.  This release
includes changes to the U.S., U.K., French, German, Italian, Spanish/Latin American,
Swedish, Swiss-German, and Swiss-French keyboard layouts to implement the extended
Lisa Character set.

Only files SYSTEM.LLD has been changed.  Therefore there are no library changes.

The release consists of the following files:

     HARDWARE.OBJ --  "USE" file for outsiders, included in Pascal system
     HWINT.OBJ    --  "USE" file for POS
     HWINTL.OBJ   --  object file for linking, both outside and in POS
     SYSTEM.LLD   --  drivers object file linked using the Workshop
     DRIVERL.OBJ  --  unlinked O.S. version of SYSTEM.LLD


This software is intended for use with MONITOR Release 12.0 and following, and
with OS Version 6.0 and following.  (Monitor users will need to copy
DRIVERS.OBJ from the release diskette to a monitor format diskette using TRANSUTIL.)
The release will function correctly with old OS's, but is incompatible with
old Monitors!
