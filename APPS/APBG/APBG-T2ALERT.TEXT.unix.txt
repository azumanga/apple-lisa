; 3. thousand separator  = next left separator, space, nonbreaking space (which is generated by
;                          the option key and the space bar), or apostrophe from decimal point.
;                          There has to be at least one numeric digit on its left side.
; 4. number digit        = '0', '1', '2', ... '9'
; 5. number of decimal places = number of number digits right of decimal point.
; 6. currency symbol     = 1 to 3 characters leading or trailing the number string.
; 7. currency position   = leading or trailing.
; Remark: There are no meta-separators like an additional blank after the currency
; symbol allowed. A trailing blank in a trailing currency symbol will be skipped,
; any other blank will be part of the currency symbol.  Anyway, LisaCalc/LisaGraph always
; puts an additional blank between the currency symbol and the number.  If a dollar sign is need
; as a leading currency symbol do not place the dollar sign into the alert.  If
; a dollar sign is placed, it will be considered as an include file to the alert program.
